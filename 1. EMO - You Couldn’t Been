You could’nt been the one for me. 
You could’ve been the one I sleep.
You cutting at a hole in my dream.
You could’ve been reality.

You could’ve been the on for me.
You could’ve been the lights I needed.
You cutting at a hole in my dream.
You could’ve seen realities.

There’s nothing left of us I see. (SIKE)
Oh shut up and follow me.  
You cutting at a hole in my dream.
You could’ve seen realities.

She could of been the one for me.
It’s super haunting.
She could of been the one my dream.
She could have been reality.

You know you’re all the knocks I need. (These doors.)
These doors are haunting me.
You know you’re the only knockers I need. (Lady.) 
Oh shut up and follow me.
1:36
You could’ve been the one for me. (But you’re not.)
You could’ve been the one I slept with. (Every night.)
You could’ve been the one of my dreams. (But you’re not.)
You could’ve been in my reality.
1:55
You know your always are taunting me.
You know I cannot I cannot I cannot sleep.
Without you these doors calling calling calling me.
It’s not you scratching scratching scratching me.

Emily why won’t you be with me is I cut myself is it cut my wrist. 
Emily the things you cannot see I never ever used to exist.  

Emily won’t you help me sleep for Evelyn doesn’t help me sleep.
Emily won’t you help me sleep for Evelyn doesn’t believe in me. 

You worship those who make fun of you.
I worship those who make fun of none.
