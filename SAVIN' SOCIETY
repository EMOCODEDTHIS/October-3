You could’ve been the only one for her, but you coil in a coward world.
You could’ve been the only for her, but you coil in cowards worlds.   

She hates me for hating the all of humanity.
She hates me for hating the all of society. 

She hates me for I’m breathing the all of sobriety.
She hates me for I’m breathing the all of Aphrodite. 

She hates me and hates me for hating all of her insanity. 

She hates me and hats for I give a fuck about trying. 

You hate this you hate that.

Hay ho,  
Hay ho,
Hay ho,
